# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-1
In this project, i was tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store.

## Data Set
SALES DATA
[SALES DATA.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17633907/SALES.DATA.xlsx)

## Introduction
The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights the following findigs:
    1. Top-selling products
    2. Regional performance, and 
    3. Monthly sales trends.

## Getting Started
I carefully analyzed the raw dataset and realized that before i can determine the findings, i will have to determine the Total Sales.
  1. I created a column for the Total sales and Multiplied the Quantity by the Units sold.
  2. I carefully moved the data to pivot table and i was able to ascertain the Total sales by product, Total Sales by Region and Total Sales by Month
